# ðŸ§© Problem: Range Sum Queries (Multiple Queries)

## ðŸ“˜ Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` of size `n`.  
You will receive `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `L` and `R` (0-based indices).  
For each query, find and print the **sum of elements** between indices `L` and `R` (inclusive).

Your solution must answer each query in **O(1)** time after **O(n)** preprocessing.

## ðŸ§  Input Format
1. An integer `n` â€” the size of the array  
2. `n` space-separated integers â€” the array elements  
3. An integer `q` â€” the number of queries  
4. `q` pairs of integers â€” each pair represents `L` and `R`

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output Format
For each query, print the **range sum** on a new line.
