## Problem 3: Longest Palindromic Subarray (Two-Pointer / Expansion)

**Statement:**
You are given an array of integers.  
Find the length of the **longest contiguous subarray** that reads the same backward as forward (palindromic subarray).

**Example:**
Input: arr = [7, 1, 2, 1, 7, 3, 3, 2, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: [7, 1, 2, 1, 7] is the longest palindromic subarray.

**Hint:**
Use **two pointers** to expand around each element and find odd/even length palindromes.
