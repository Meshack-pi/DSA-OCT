# Terminologies

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem. |
| Data Structure | A way of organizing data for efficient access and modification (e.g., arrays, linked lists, binary trees). |
| Time Complexity | A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. |
| Space Complexity | A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. |
| Big O Notation | A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function as the input size grows; commonly used to express time and space complexity. |
| Recursion | A programming technique where a function calls itself, typically with a smaller or simpler input. |
| Divide and Conquer | A problem-solving strategy that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them (often recursively), and combines the results. |
| Brute Force | A simple, straightforward approach that tries all possible solutions and selects the best one; usually easy to implement but may be inefficient. |
